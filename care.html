        <h1>Animal Care Tips</h1>
        <p>At Animal Haven, we believe in providing the best care for your furry and feathered friends. Here are some essential care tips for different animals:</p>

        <section class="care-tip">
            <h2>Dogs</h2>
            <p>Dogs are loyal companions, but they require attention and regular care. Ensure your dog gets daily exercise, a balanced diet, proper grooming, and regular vet check-ups. Mental stimulation through toys and training is also essential for their well-being.</p>

            <h2>Cats</h2>
            <p>Cats are independent creatures but still need proper care. Provide fresh food and water, a clean litter box, and regular grooming. Cats need stimulation, so interactive toys and scratching posts will keep them entertained. Regular vet visits are necessary for their health.</p>
        </section>

        <section class="care-tip">
            <h2>Birds</h2>
            <p>Birds are social creatures that need a clean cage, fresh water, and healthy food. Make sure to provide stimulating toys, and let them out of their cage regularly for exercise. Monitor their health and ensure they have plenty of time for mental engagement.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="care-tip">
            <h2>Turtles</h2>
            <p>Turtles need both water and land to thrive. Ensure they have a clean tank with a proper filtration system, a basking area, and a heat lamp for warmth. A balanced diet and regular tank cleaning are key to their health and well-being.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="care-tip">
            <h2>Rabbits</h2>
            <p>Rabbits need ample space to hop around and exercise. Provide fresh vegetables, hay, and water, and make sure they have a safe and clean environment. Rabbits also enjoy mental stimulation through toys, tunnels, and interaction with their owners.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="care-tip">
            <h2>Pigeon</h2>
            <p>A daily clean of the cage or loft, a fresh floor covering of straw or wood shavings, plus new, clean water twice daily and a daily supply of fresh food is essential. Remember to keep the feed and water containers clean too, sterilising them regularly.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="care-tip">
            <h2>Fish</h2>
            <p>Fish require a clean and well-maintained tank. Ensure their water temperature is suitable for the species and that the water is regularly filtered. Provide them with a proper diet and monitor their health by checking for any unusual behavior or signs of illness.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="care-tip">
            <h2>Elephants</h2>
            <p>Provide ample space for exercise, a varied diet of grass, fruits, and vegetables, and fresh water. Keep their living area clean and ensure they have shade and shelter. Regular health check-ups and mental stimulation through activities are essential. Keep elephants in social groups, as they are highly social animals.</p>
        </section>
        <section class="care-tip">
            <h2>Hummingbird</h2>
            <p>To care for hummingbirds, provide a clean feeder with homemade nectar (1 part sugar to 4 parts water) and ensure it’s changed regularly. Create a safe environment with nectar-rich plants and a shallow water source. Clean feeders to prevent mold and bacteria. Keep them safe from predators and window collisions. If you find an injured hummingbird, contact a wildlife rehabilitator for help.</p>
